# Make Your Project Stand Out From The Crowd

While you know exactly what power lies within your project, just looking at a rendering of the boards won't be helpful to most other people in the community.
Follow this Proper-Project-Protocol to check your project for publication readiness.

### Is Your Project Published?

You want people to find your project? The first step you need to make, is to set your project to "published".
Just set the "Published?" switch to "Yes" and you are good to go.

### What Should A Fellow Community Member Know About Your Project?

If you find an answer to all of these questions you are on a good path to a top project!

- What does your project do?
- What experience level is needed?
- How long did it take you to build this project?
- What tools did you use?
- Do you need additional materials like cases etc.? And where can you get them?
- Which revision of your board is working?

Of course you should also document the answers to these questions in the readme section of your project.
And remember, a little wit is always appreciated ;)

### Complete Your Documentation

The most powerful projects are the ones that are fully documented. Make sure that all the proper files are uploaded and all the parts are assigned.

### Add A Picture Of Your Build

Nice Pictures are key to people clicking on your project.
After all, a pircture paints a thousand words.

Take a snapshot of your finished project and upload it to your projects page.

### Use The Power Of Social Media

Social media sites like Facebook and Twitter are powerful tools to get the word out about you project.
Share a picture of your end result and the link to the public project page, using the hashtag **#creativegenius** and make sure to tag **@AislerHQ**, so we can find and share your project as well.

But there are far more places to write about your project than just Facebook and Twitter. Be sure to post to relevant forums or maybe your own blog, too.
Btw., if you know of forums you think we should check out some time, feel free to shoot me a mail at sebastian@aisler.net
