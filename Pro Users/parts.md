# Adding Parts Tp Your Project

Adding parts to your design is super easy. You can either

- upload your schematic, or
- add parts manually

### Adding A Schematic

Uploading a schematic is the easiest way to document your bill of material (BOM).

1. First, on your project's page, click "Details" under the "Bill of Materials" section.
2. Then, on the upper right-hand corner, under "Import schematic drawing" hit the "SELECT FILE" button.
3. Finally chose the right schematic file from your computer and click "open".

That's it. All the parts should be assigned automatically.

Wasn't so hard, was it?

### Adding Parts Manually

This option takes a little more effort, but is totally doable as well.

1. First, on your project's page, click "Details" under the "Bill of Materials" section.
2. Then, on the upper right-hand corner, hit the "ADD PART MANUALLY" button.
3. Search for the part you want to add to your project and choose one from the list shown.
4. Repeat step 2 and 3 until all the necessary parts have been added.

Not much harder, right?
