### Who is behind AISLER? ###

When Felix and Patrick met at a Barbecue in 2014, they had no idea they would soon be running a company together. They both felt that creative geniuses should have a way to easily document their projects for the community. AISLER was born. The concept has been fine tuned and grew eversince. After many iterations, today it is the smartest all-in-one solution for your electronics project. The two eventually realized, that to bring all their ideas to life, the team had to expand and so the AISLER family is steadily growing and now has a core team of 5 people. AISLER's goal is to make prototyping as fun and effortless as possible, because the creative genius behind a project should focus only on creating and not have to deal with over complicated order forms and multiple suppliers.

AISLER's headquarters are located in Lemiers, right beside Aachen, just on the Dutch side of the border.

### Where are the circuit boards made? ###

We have partnered with a manufacturer from Germany that produces boards for the car industry, medical device industry and other industrial grade applications, and, well now also for us :-) We are extremely proud that any author can now benefit from their board manufacturing quality – Made in Germany.
 
### What are Precious Parts and Stellar Stencils? ###

We want you to have a true all-in-one prototyping experience. That is why we, besides beautiful boards, also offer precious parts and stellar stencils.

Our intelligent parts package will make sure you have a finished project at the end of the day. This package won’t blow your budget but we made sure to add a few safety extras here and there. 
All you need to do is document your bill of materials (BOM) and you can get your parts right with your boards.

To make soldering SMD parts super easy, you can now get a stencil for you project as well. No extra work needed. Just add the stencil to your shopping basket and you're all set. Our stencils are made from 120 µm thin high quality stainless steel.

### How are the circuit board's production parameters and which technologies do you support? ###

Your boards will all come with green soldermask, white top and bottom legend, and will have ENIG surface plating. We only use high-class FR4, 1.6mm TG150 material. We currently limit the offering to two-layer boards with 35µm copper weight. If you need more copper or want to have 4-layer boards please join our Beta-List by sending us an email to support@aisler.net.

### You say you are affordable, how much do you charge? ###

We have tried to make our pricing as transparent as possible. For a simple pricing overview feel free to use our calculator. If you find a price for a batch of three PCBs somewhere else that is more affordable, we guarantee to match that price. Just send us an email to [felix@aisler.net](mailto:felix@aisler.net)


### What are the design rules for the PCBs? ###

The following design rules should be respected if you like to manufacture your PCBs with us.

- Min. trace width: 100 μm
- Min. trace spacing: 100 μm
- Min. pitch between traces: 200 μm
- Spacing PCB edge to trace: 200 μm
- Spacing via to via: 0.30 mm
- Spacing drill to drill: 0.15 mm
- Min. drill diameter for vias: 0.2 mm
- Min. via pad diameter: Via drill + 0.25 mm
- Min. stroke width of legend print: 100 μm
 
### What file extensions should my Gerber files have? ###

We accept quite a lot of file extensions, but to make sure everything gets detected correctly you should use these extensions:

<table>
<tr><th>Gerber Layer Name</th><th>Layer</th></tr>
<tr> <td>project_name.toplayer.ger</td><td>Top Layer</td> </tr>
<tr> <td>project_name.bottomlayer.ger</td><td>Bottom Layer</td> </tr>
<tr> <td>project_name.topsoldermask.ger</td><td>Top Soldermask</td> </tr>
<tr> <td>project_name.bottomsoldermask.ger</td><td>Bottom Soldermask</td> </tr>
<tr> <td>project_name.topsilkscreen.ger</td><td>Top Silkscreen</td> </tr>
<tr> <td>project_name.bottomsilkscreen.ger</td><td>Bottom Silkscreen</td> </tr>
<tr> <td>project_name.boardoutline.ger</td><td>Board Outline</td> </tr>
<tr> <td>project_name.xln</td><td>PTH Drills</td> </tr>
<tr> <td>project_name_npth.xln</td><td>NPTH Holes</td> </tr>
</table>

**Please note:** Upload all your Gerbers in one ZIP-File for us to automatically detect your project's parameters. Also, please remove all unnecessary files in the zip folder.

### I’m a business and would like to receive an invoice without VAT ###

We are based in the Netherlands, which means every business inside a member state of the European Union is eligible for a VAT-free invoice according to EU reverse charge regulations. Please contact us via [felix@aisler.net](mailto:felix@aisler.net), send your valid Tax-Id and we will gladly set your account to a VAT-free account. When you are logged in, you will then see prices without VAT and your invoice will be VAT-free. Please note that you still have to abide to local tax laws. For addresses outside the European Union we automatically deduct the VAT so no registration is necessary.

### Do you charge for shipping? ###

Yes and No. We will send boards for free through regular mail when the order is higher than 30 EUR. If you prefer them to be shipped as insured mail you can select as an option during your order. We know shipping works smoothly in Europe & US. Want to receive your Kit in other countries, please send us an email at [felix@aisler.net](mailto:felix@aisler.net) or contact us through our social media accounts.

### Do you ship world-wide? ###

Yes, we currently have good experience with shipping to countries in the European Union, United States and Canada. All other countries are possible, but we don't guarantee a delivery time. 

### What is the lead time for the production? ###

Regular 2-Layer circuit board orders will be shipped to you within 12 business days or less. We will update on the progress of the production and if any problems arise that could extend that timeline.

### What methods of payment do you accept? ###

We currently accept wire transfer, major credit cards, Bitcoin and Paypal. All transfers are handled securely through our payment provider **Mollie**.
