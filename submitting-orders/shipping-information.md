# Shipping Information
If you want to know how we ship your manufactured project or how much it costs, you will find the information here. We generally ship within **12 days** max. If you live in Europe you should hold your project in your hands within **14 days** max.  

### Shipping options ###
You have the following shipping options available with us:

<table>
<tr><th>Shipping type</th><th>Cost</th><th>Tracking</th></tr>
<tr><td>Standard Mail</td><td>€ 6,00</td><td>no</td></tr>
<tr><td>Premium Mail</td><td>€ 12,00</td><td>yes</td></tr>
<tr><td>Express Mail</td><td>€ 32,00</td><td>yes</td></tr>
</table>

Standard Shipping is included in all orders above 30 Euro.

**Pro tip:** AISLER uses an intelligent shopping basket. If you order multiple times and you are on the same batch, your orders will be grouped together internally. Therefore, if you pay for shipping once (or exceed our 30 Euro threshold), you will not be charged a second time.
