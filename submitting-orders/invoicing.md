# Invoicing and accepted payment options
Have questions about invoicing or payment options, you will find the answer here.

### Accepted methods of payment ###
AISLER uses **Mollie**, a Dutch payment service provider, trusted by many webshops.

We support the following payment types:

- Paypal
- Creditcard
- Bank transfer
- Bitcoin
- iDeal 
- KBC/CBC, Belfius, and Bancontact
- Sofort Ãœberweisung

Everytime you use the **Pay Now** functionality on AISLER, you will be redirected to a page on Mollie that allows you to select your favorite payment type. After you successfully went through the payment process you will be redirected to one of AISLER's pages.

For all pre-payment types, we will send your order only once we have received your payment. All methods other than Bank Transfer ensure that you receive your order directly after we have made it ready for shipment. You will be able to download your invoice after you have placed your order.  If you are a European business you can apply for **Purchase on Account**. Please refer to the next section for details.
 

### Invoicing for businesses based in the in the EU ###

#### Purchase on Account ("Kauf auf Rechnung") ####
You can apply for Purchase on Account. For that we will need a valid billing address in the EU and your VAT ID. In order to compensate the administrative burden of this process we charge a fee of **EUR 10** per order that is made with **Purchase on Account**. This item will be automatically added to your invoice. 

Once approved by us, instead of being redirected to a payment screen your order will be automatically confirmed and you will receive an order confirmation email. The payment term for Purchase on Account is 10 business days after you have received the order. Please note, that we may suspend this service for your business if you fail to pay in due time.  

To apply, please send a short e-mail to [felix@aisler.net](mailto:felix@aisler.net)


#### EU Reverse Charge / VAT-Free invoicing ###
Are you a business in the EU and want to take advantage of the EU reverse charge regulation? No problem, we are based in the Netherlands, which means every business inside a member state of the European Union is eligible for a VAT-free invoice according to EU reverse charge regulations. This does not apply a) when you ship to the Netherlands, or b) are a Dutch entity. In that case you can deduct the VAT with your quarterly declaration. 

Please register an account with us, login and navigate to your [profile page](https://go.aisler.net/account/profile). We will then automatically set your account to a VAT-free account. When you are logged in and eligible for VAT-free, you will then see prices without VAT and your invoice will be VAT-free. Please note that you still have to abide to local tax laws. 

For addresses outside the European Union we automatically deduct the VAT so no registration is necessary.
